Legal Buddy — User Manual

• Overview- Legal Buddy is an AI-powered case orientation tool designed to help people understand their criminal court case using public records. It explains what has happened so far, where the case currently stands, and what typically happens next — in clear, non-judgmental language.

* This tool is educational, not legal advice.

• Who This Is For

    • People looking up their own Cook County criminal case

    • Users who want clarity without legal jargon

    • Students, advocates, or researchers exploring court procedure

    • No legal background required.


- Getting Started (Quick Start)-

1. Open the app.

2. Enter your Cook County case ID.

3. Press enter. --> Legal Buddy will:

    1) Fetch public case data

    2) Identify the current procedural stage

    3) Explain the case in plain language

- Core Features -
1. Case Explanation- After entering a case ID, Legal Buddy:

    • Summarizes key facts (dates, charges, status)

    • Identifies the current procedural stage

    • Provides a calm, human-readable explanation of what that stage means

2. Timeline View- Ask “Show my timeline”:

    You’ll see a visual timeline showing:

        • Incident

        • Arrest

        • Filing

        • Arraignment

        • Current stage (highlighted)

        • This helps users understand the sequence of events, not just isolated dates.

3. Procedural Simulator- Ask “What usually comes next?”:    

    This opens a choose-your-own-adventure style simulator rooted at the user’s current stage.

    You can explore:

        • Discovery

        • Motions (suppress, dismiss, discovery motions)

        • Plea discussions

        • Trial-setting paths

    ⚠️ This is educational only — it shows common procedural forks, not predictions.


4. Similar Case Outcome Statistics- Ask “How do similar cases usually turn out?”:

    Legal Buddy will:

        • Build a comparison cohort from public Cook County disposition data

        • Show outcome distributions (dismissed, plea, convicted, etc.)

        • Display sample size and timing information

        • Results appear as a visual chart before the written explanation.



5. Secret Pink Mode 🌸 Type "pink mode": The UI switches to a soft pink theme. This is optional, cosmetic, and entirely vibes-based.
